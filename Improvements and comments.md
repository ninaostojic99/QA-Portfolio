Improvements and comments for the web application Ananas([https://ananas.rs/](https://ananas.rs/))

***1.Improvement***   
**Current**: The menu icon in the top left corner located to the left of the page logo is clickable. When clicked, it opens a list of categories. The categories are not sorted alphabetically.

**Request**:A label titled *Sort by* should be added above the category list. When clicked, it should display a combo box(dropdown) with the following sorting options: Alphabetically(A-Z), Alphabetically(Z-A), Most popular, Default.

**Reason**:   
Setting a sorting method reduces cognitive load by presenting content in a familiar, predictable order. This improves navigation efficiency, making it easier for users to locate specific categories without unnecessary searching or confusion.

***2.Improvement***   
**Current**: The website uses a light theme by default, there is no option for dark theme.

**Request:** Add a dark mode toggle button to the upper-right corner of the webpage, on the left side of the profile icon. The user should be able to switch between light and dark modes. On hover, a tooltip should appear indicating the currently active mode.

**Reason:** Reduces eye strain and respects user preferences which leads to increased satisfaction, engagement and modern UI.

***3.Improvement***  
**Current**: The upper-menu overlaps with the product content, some product elements are partially hidden which makes it harder to interact.

**Request:** Implement auto-scroll functionality to ensure that the product section is fully visible and not hidden behind the upper-menu. When a user navigates to the section the page should automatically scroll to correctly position the content.

**Reason:** Improves content visibility and enhances the overall user experience by providing smoother, more intuitive navigation, perceived polish and professionalism of the user interface.

***Comment***  
On the desktop version of the site, the 'Preporuƒçeno' button located in the upper right corner of the product page is not clearly presented as a drop-down menu for sorting. Its purpose is only revealed after it is clicked. Replacing the label with 'Sortiranje' could improve clarity for users.
